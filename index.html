    <li><h4>My-First-Webpage</h4></li>
    <p>This is a basic website using only html. It allowed me to practice how to indent and organize HTML correctly.
  It was also a way for me to allow me to begin learning how to use HTML tags to create websites. You can link to this site <a href="https://github.com/q4hmad/my-first-webpage">here.</a>


    <li><h4>Nasheed</h4></li>
      <p>This site was meant to be a way to practice using floats and spans as well as further practice with writing CSS rule to style particular elements in my HTML.Padding, margins, and the box model were also introduced and practiced here. To see more you can click <a href="url coming soon"</a></p>



    <li><h4>Kitty</h4></li>
     <p> This was a site meant to showcase CSS rules and how they can be applied to create columns, sidebars, and other alignments. To see if this was a successful attempt, (spoiler alert, it completely wasn't), just click <a href="url coming soon"</a>
